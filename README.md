### Interpretability tutorial

This interpretability tutorial uses some features from scikit-learn which are under-development:

* DataFrame handling with OpenML datasets:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13902
* Fast partial dependence plot for Gradient Boosting Decsision Trees:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13769
* Permutation feature importance:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13146

These features have been combined into a scikit-learn branch in the following
repository: https://github.com/glemaitre/scikit-learn/tree/workshop

You can refer to the following documentation to install scikit-learn from such
source:
